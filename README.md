# Problem Statement:
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

Performed Data Cleaning using pandas then performed data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# Findings
Clearly Fandango has an uneven distribution. We can also see that RT critics have the most uniform distribution. Let's directly compare these two.
